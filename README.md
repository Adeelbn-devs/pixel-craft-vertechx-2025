This website was developed for the 'Pixel Craft' (Web Development) competition, a core event of Vertechx 13.0, the National Level Inter-Collegiate Technical Fest hosted by MVJ College of Engineering.

I am thrilled to share that this project secured 2nd Place in the competition!

The website is designed around the fest's central theme, "Pixelate," which is reflected in the project's overall concept and aesthetics.
